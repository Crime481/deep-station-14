    The latest innovation in beligerent employee management, courtesy of Nanotrasen's "Xenos Affairs" research division.
    The Mk3 Loyalty Implant consists of a series of synthetic-mycotoxin sacs surgically implanted inside the user's lymph nodes.
    These sacs are biocoded to detonate and disperse their lethal payload once a period of 24 hours have passed.
    In order to ensure user "Loyalty", a "Delaying Serum" is provided to users at the end of each shift.
